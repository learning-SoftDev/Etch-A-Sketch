# Etch-A-Sketch

This is a small project which aims to make an electronic version of the physical game Etch-A-Sketch. It was created during my learning curve in TOP (The Odin Project). 

Things I learned:
-Deep understanding of DOM manipulations in javascript
-Deep understanding of events specifically when clicking, mouseover, mousedown, onchange, and etc.
-Deep understanding on when to use flex, grid, and table when layouting.
-Familiarized the syntax further for html, css, and js.
